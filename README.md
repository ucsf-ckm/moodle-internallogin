moodle-internallogin
====================

Allow Moodle user to login with internal accounts. This is useful when your Moodle site is redirecting the default login to an alternate login URL (like to a Shibboleth IdP.) With this installed on your Moodle root directory, you can just visit http://&lt;yoursite>/internallogin/ to log into as administrator and such.
